# CoreTable
Understanding how CoreData works in Swift 3.

## Why this project?
In Swift 3, Apple has changed a few things about Core Data. Those were well documented, but as we know, sample code of a 
hands-on project often is better than the sample code for the concept (And often also more self-explanatory).

## What does this app do?
It's basically just a task management app. List a task and remove it when it's done. Simple as that.
