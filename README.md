# CoreTable

## Reason For Repository
In iOS 10, the concept of CoreData with Swift 3 has been changed by Apple. Despite the documentation, hands-on projects are a better explanation of changes in most cases and show how to implement them in own projects.

## App Example
This example is a simple listing app in which you can add items and subsequently remove them when they are no longer needed.
